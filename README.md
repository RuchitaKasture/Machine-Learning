# Medical Insurance
This project uses machine learning to predict medical insurance costs based on factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and more. It involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, building regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree), and evaluating them using metrics like MAE and RÂ² Score. Visualizations help understand data trends and model performance.
Tools used include Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
